# ftsy-bundesliga

*Fantasy Bundesliga* is a private fantasy soccer manager game for Bundesliga. Around 2018 a friend and me grew tired from the likes of *Comunio* or 
*Kickbase* while at the same time discovering NFL Fantasy managers. By developing *Fantasy Bundesliga* we tried to translate the game mode of NFL Fantasy (draft, live scores, waivers, head-to-heads, etc.) to the Bundesliga world. At first in Google sheets solution. Later with this small website project.
